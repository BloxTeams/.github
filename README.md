<h1 align="center">"Building the future of Roblox commissions"</h1>

BloxTeams is an organisation aimed to create a secure platform for Roblox developers to work on. We are building BloxTeams a platform where Roblox developers can engage in secure commissions thanks to our automated middle man system.

We sometimes also release open source libraries that we create for our platform so that everyone can benefit from them.
